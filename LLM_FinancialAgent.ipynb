I'll focus on key financial metrics like revenue growth, earnings per share (EPS), debt levels, and profit margins to assess financial health.

            "\n",

            "    * **Financial Performance:** Trends in revenue, earnings, profitability, and cash flow.\n",
            "    * **Valuation:** Metrics such as Price-to-Earnings ratio (P/E), Price-to-Book ratio (P/B), and Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis.\n",
